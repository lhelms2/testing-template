Getting Started with High-Performance Computing
================================================

**There are no specific prerequisite courses or high-performance computing (HPC) experience required before using XXXX.** However, if you are unfamiliar with using a HPC cluster, it is highly recommended that you take NCSAâ€™s short tutorial `Using an HPC Cluster for Scientific Applications <https://www.hpc-training.org/xsede/moodle/enrol/index.php?id=71>`_ before continuing.

You can also browse the full list of NCSA's `HPC-Moodle Self-Paced Tutorials <https://www.hpc-training.org/xsede/moodle/course/index.php?categoryid=11>`_ to learn more about other HPC topics.
